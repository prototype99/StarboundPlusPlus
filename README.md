# Starbound++ remix
A version of starbound++ designed to be compatible with frackin universe and retain more of the vanilla game balance and item descriptions, platinum ore should also appear in planet surveys (unconfirmed). due to the fact that the matter manipulator fully upgraded is in many cases far more effective than any pickaxes or drills ( and it never breaks!) any pickaxes or drills that are exclusive to the original starbound++ do not feature in this mod.

installing
____________
installation is a painless process. please note the following things below:
1. if you have any planets you are particularly proud of please back them up before installation (see uninstalling)
2. you may need to generate a fresh universe before you will see any planets that contain platinum
_______________
uninstalling
_______________
if you do not plan to replace this mod with another that uses platinum, please make sure to get rid of any platinum you have before uninstalling. if you do not, your character may become bricked until you reinstall this mod or install another that uses platinum ore, and platinum bars.
________________________________________
can i switch between the two versions?
________________________________________
in most cases yes. please note: any drills/pickaxes carried over from an original starbound++ will either cause repetitive crashes or turn into generic items, therefore it is recommended not to use an original starbound++ save with this mod. Saves from this mod should be able to transfer to the original starbound++ mod with no issues.
